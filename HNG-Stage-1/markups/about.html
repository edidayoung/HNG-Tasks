        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p data-testid="test-about-bio">
          I'm a passionate frontend developer with a strong focus on creating accessible, 
          responsive, and delightful user interfaces. My journey in web development began 
          during my university years, and since then I've been constantly learning and 
          evolving with the ever-changing landscape of frontend technologies. I believe 
          that great code should not only function well but also be maintainable, scalable, 
          and enjoyable to work with.

        <h2>Goals in This Program</h2>
        <p data-testid="test-about-goals">
          My primary goal in the HNG internship is to deepen my understanding of modern 
          frontend development practices and collaborate with like-minded developers. 
          Specifically, I aim to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Master advanced React patterns and state management techniques</li>
          <li>Improve my testing skills with React Testing Library and Jest</li>
          <li>Enhance my knowledge of performance optimization strategies</li>
          <li>Build meaningful connections within the developer community</li>
          <li>Contribute to real-world projects that solve actual problems</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
        <p data-testid="test-about-confidence">
          While I'm comfortable with core frontend technologies, I recognize areas where 
          I need to grow:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Advanced TypeScript patterns and generics</li>
          <li>Complex state management in large-scale applications</li>
          <li>Advanced accessibility patterns beyond basic ARIA attributes</li>
          <li>Performance optimization for very large datasets</li>
          <li>Backend integration patterns and best practices</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Note to Future Self</h2>
        <p data-testid="test-about-future-note">
          Remember why you started this journey - the excitement of seeing your code come 
          to life and make a difference. Stay curious, keep learning, and don't be afraid 
          to ask for help. The tech community is incredibly supportive, and growth happens 
          when you step outside your comfort zone. Maintain your passion for creating 
          beautiful, accessible experiences that users love.
        </p>

      <section class="about-section">
        <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
        <p data-testid="test-about-extra">
          I'm particularly excited about the future of web development with emerging 
          technologies like WebAssembly, Progressive Web Apps, and the continued evolution 
          of CSS. The balance between performance, user experience, and developer experience 
          continues to fascinate me. I believe that as developers, we have a responsibility 
          to build inclusive, sustainable, and ethical digital products that serve all users 
          regardless of their abilities or circumstances.
